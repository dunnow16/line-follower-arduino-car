# Arduino Line Follower
Was used with an IR sensor to make quick decisions while following a white line over a black board. The ratio of white to black ideally causes different readings for the sensor to help make a desision whether to move the left or right wheel faster to turn in the correct direction to stay on the track. DC motors for each whell of a small autonomous car were used. Another type of motor would likely be better. DC was too fast and hard to change its speed quickly.
